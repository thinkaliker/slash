====================================

Info
----

I hope to eventually turn this into a game!

The original idea was to learn how to program in Java for Android, but also recreate an iOS game, TreeConnect.


Compiling
---------

1) JDK/JRE 1.7 or higher

2) IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio (you can probably find a way to compile with a different IDE)

3) Android SDK - API level 15 or higher
